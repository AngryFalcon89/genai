The registration schedule will be announced by the Dean for every semester. The registration procedure will be notified by the Chief Coordinator, B. Tech. Programs.

(b) A student will normally register for higher semester courses only if he has also registered for un-cleared courses of previous semesters, especially in the case of un-cleared courses of first two semesters.

(c) A student will have the option to add/delete/alter the courses in his/her registration within a week of the registration subject to such conditions as may be imposed by the department concerned from time to time.

(d) A student can drop a course from his/her registration by submitting a request to his/her departmental coordinator up to a date specified on his/her registration card. A registered course will be counted as an attempt even if the student remains absent in the Examination(s).

(e) No student will be allowed to register for more than 40 credits in a semester.

(f) A student may be denied registration in a course due to reasons of paucity of staff or space or other facilities, especially in case the student is registering a course for improving the grade in a passed course.

(g) If a student fails to register in two consecutive semesters without specific permission from the Dean, his/her name may be removed from the rolls of the faculty. Such a student may apply to the Dean for re-admission stating the reasons for not being able to register for two consecutive semesters and the Dean will take suitable decision on the merit of the case.

(h) Registration for the graduating course will be done after the declaration of the results of each semester. Last date of registration will be notified by the Dean.

(i) A department may allow a final year student to register up to a maximum of 3 courses, not running in the current semester in mode 'c' (defined in clause 7.1 a), only if without it, graduation of the student will be delayed by at least one semester.

1.  has CGPA equal to or more than 7.5
2.  has no backlog courses
3.  has cleared the pre-requisite courses of the course he/she wants to register

**7.2 Graduating Course**
A student may be allowed to register for one course of not more than 4 credits if he/she is able to graduate by passing such a course, irrespective of whether the course is being offered in the current semester to regular students or not, provided that the student has fulfilled the attendance requirement earlier and has been awarded E or I grade in that course. Such a course shall be known as a graduating course.

**7.3 Registration for minor degree**
Students having secured a CGPA equal to or more than 7.5 at the end of second semester without any backlog, may register courses of another branch of study, as listed in the curriculum, for a minor degree in that branch. The concerned department may permit registration in these courses depending on merit of the student and availability of seats.

## 8. Attendance (In lieu of Chapter XVII of the Academic Ordinances)
Attendance in each course separately is compulsory at least once. Students who have put in 75% or more attendance in a course in a semester will be eligible to appear in the End-Semester Examination of that course. Students who have put in 65% or more but less than 75% attendance in a course may be considered for condonation of shortage of attendance in that course by the condonation committee. Students whose attendance in a course is less than 65% or whose shortage in attendance has not been condoned will not be eligible to appear in the End-Semester Examination of that course and will be awarded grade 'F' in that course and all marks obtained in any component of the course-evaluation will stand cancelled. However, in case a student is repeating a course and the student has already fulfilled the attendance requirement in that course, he/she will not be detained due to shortage of attendance in that course during the repeating semester.

## 9. Examination and Evaluation (In lieu of Clause (9) of Chapter XV of the existing Academic Ordinances)

**9.1 Components of Evaluation**
Each course will be evaluated out of 100 marks. The courses will normally have the following components of evaluation:

**(a) Theory Courses**
* Continuous Evaluation: 15 marks
* Internal Examination: 25 marks
* End-Semester Examination: 60 marks

**(b) Laboratory courses including Seminar, Colloquium, Project, mini-project etc.**
* Continuous Evaluation: 60 marks
* End-Semester Examination: 40 marks

However, for special academic reasons, some courses may have different weight for different components of evaluation from that given above. Such special reasons will be spelt out clearly in the curriculum.

**9.2 Grading System**
The combined marks obtained by a student in various components of evaluation of a course shall be converted into regular letter grades with their equivalent grade points as specified below:

| Grade | Grade points | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A+ | 10 | Outstanding |
| A | 9 | Excellent |
| B+ | 8 | Very good |
| B | 7 | Good |
| C | 6 | Average |
| D | 5 | Satisfactory |
| E | 0 | Unsatisfactory (Fail) |
| F | 0 | Detained due to shortage of attendance |
| I | 0 | Incomplete/Absent in the End-Semester Examination |
| Z | 0 | Cancelled due to other reasons |

The following marks ranges may ordinarily be used for the award of grades to the students in a **theory course**:

| Range | Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 85 and above | A+ |
| 75 and above but less than 85 | A |
| 65 and above but less than 75 | B+ |
| 55 and above but less than 65 | B |
| 45 and above but less than 55 | C |
| 35 and above but less than 45 | D (Minimum Pass Grade) |
| Less than 35 | E |

For a **lab course** the grade ranges will be as follows:

| Range | Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 85 and above | A+ |
| 75 and above but less than 85 | A |
| 65 and above but less than 75 | B+ |
| 55 and above but less than 65 | B |
| 45 and above but less than 55 | C (Minimum Pass Grade) |
| Less than 45 | E |

Two grace marks may be awarded by the examiner for passing a course and one grace mark may be awarded by the examiner to elevate the grade. Any fraction in any component of evaluation should be rounded off to the next whole number. The following distribution of various grades will be considered as normal. In such a case grade range cannot be modified.

| Grades | Population Percentage Range (Theory Courses) | Population Percentage Range (Lab Courses) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A+ and A (combined) | 15-50% | 25-75% |
| B+ and B (combined) | 30-70% | 25-75% |
| C and D (combined) | 15-40% | 0-15% |

For a particular course, if the grade distribution is out of the range as described above, the examiner(s) may propose higher or lower grade, but the final decision rests with the Result Moderation Committee. However, the minimum passing grade should never be awarded if a student secures below 35 marks (including 2 grace marks) in a theory course and 45 marks (including 2 grace marks) in a lab course.

**9.3 Evaluation of a Graduating Course**
A graduating course shall be evaluated on the basis of the End-Semester Examination component of the course alone. The student shall appear only in the End-Semester Examination of the graduating course. In theory courses, grade D shall be awarded if the student concerned obtains 35 or more percentage of the marks allotted to End-Semester Examination alone. In laboratory courses grade C shall be awarded if the student concerned obtains 45 or more percentage of the marks allotted to End-Semester Examination alone. In case the marks obtained are less than 35% for theory courses and 45% for laboratory courses, grade E will be awarded. Two grace marks, however, will be awarded for passing the course.

**9.4 Earned Credits (EC)**
If a student obtains the minimum pass grade in a course, he/she earns the credits assigned to that course. Students admitted through lateral entry will be deemed to have earned credits allocated to the first-year courses.

**9.5 Performance Indices**
At the end of every semester a student's performance will be indicated by Earned Credits (EC), a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA), and a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The SGPA is the credit-weighted average of grade points of all courses registered during a semester and is computed as follows:

$$SGPA = (C_1G_1 + C_2G_2 + ......) / (C_1 + C_2 + .......)$$

Where $C_1, C_2, ...$ are the credits assigned to courses and $G_1, G_2, ...$ are the grade points earned in those courses. The CGPA is the credit-weighted average of grade points of all courses registered since admission. In case a student has registered a course more than once, the best grade will be considered for calculation of CGPA.

**9.6 Repetition of a Failed Course**
If a student registers a course but fails to fulfill attendance requirement, he/she will be required to register the course again in mode 'a'. In case a student completes attendance requirement but fails to secure any of the pass grades in a theory course, he/she has option of registering the course again either in mode 'b' or in mode 'c'. In case a student completes attendance requirement but fails to secure any of the pass grades in a laboratory course, he/she has option of registering the course again either in mode 'a' or in mode 'c'.

**9.7 Repetition of a Passed Course**
A student may repeat a theory course to improve his/her grade in that course only once, provided that he/she has passed that course in a single attempt. In such case the student will have to register the course again either in mode 'b' or in mode 'c'. Requirements of mode 'b' and 'c' registrations are same as described in clause 7.1 a. For the purpose of calculating the SGPA the recently obtained grade will be considered while for CGPA the better of the two grades will be counted.

**9.8 Conduct of Examinations**
(a) The examiners for the End-Semester Examination of all theory courses will normally be the teacher(s) associated with the course. The Seminar, Colloquium courses will be examined by the teacher(s) associated with the course and one or more examiners from among the teachers of the department to be recommended by the BOS of the department concerned. The laboratory and project courses will be examined by the teachers(s) associated with the course and an external examiner not in the service of the university at the time of examination. In case the external examiner does not turn up for the examination, the Chairman of the department concerned, in consultation with the course in-charge, shall call another person to act as the external examiner, even from within the University, if necessary.

(b) The End-Semester Examination of all graduating courses shall be conducted simultaneously after the declaration of the result of each semester on a date notified by the Dean.

**9.9 Moderation Committees**
(a) **Question Paper Moderation Committee:** There shall be a Moderation Committee of the concerned Department consisting of the following members to moderate the Question Papers of the End- Semester Examination.
* (i) Chairman of the Department concerned - (Convener)
* (ii) One senior teacher of the Department in each broad area of specialization (to be appointed by the BOS).
