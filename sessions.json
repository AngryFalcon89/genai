      "content": "To determine the subject options available for a mechanical engineering student in their 4th semester, I would need to know the specific courses offered in the 4th semester for mechanical engineering students. However, based on the provided context, I can see the courses offered in the 4th semester for some branches, but not specifically for mechanical engineering.\n\nAssuming the student has 2 back papers from the 3rd semester, to clear these back papers while progressing to the next semester, the student has a few options:\n\n1. **Register for the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses**: The student can register for the 2 back papers from the 3rd semester along with the courses offered in the 4th semester. However, the student needs to ensure that the total credits for the semester do not exceed 40 credits (as per Rule 5.2/10.1).\n\n2. **Register for the back papers in the summer semester or as a supplementary exam**: If the student is not able to register for the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses, they can register for the back papers in the summer semester or as a supplementary exam. This will allow the student to clear the back papers without overloading themselves with too many courses in the 4th semester.\n\n3. **Postpone registering for some 4th-semester courses**: If the student is not able to clear the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses, they can postpone registering for some 4th-semester courses and focus on clearing the back papers first. This will allow the student to focus on clearing the back papers without overloading themselves with too many courses.\n\nTo provide more specific guidance, I would need to know the following information:\n\n* The specific courses offered in the 4th semester for mechanical engineering students\n* The credit values of the back papers and the 4th-semester courses\n* The current semester load of the student\n\nWith this information, I can provide more tailored advice on how the student can clear their back papers while progressing to the next semester."
