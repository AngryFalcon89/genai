However, based on the provided context, I can see the courses offered in the 4th semester for some branches, but not specifically for mechanical engineering.\n\nAssuming the student has 2 back papers from the 3rd semester, to clear these back papers while progressing to the next semester, the student has a few options:\n\n1. **Register for the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses**: The student can register for the 2 back papers from the 3rd semester along with the courses offered in the 4th semester. However, the student needs to ensure that the total credits for the semester do not exceed 40 credits (as per Rule 5.2/10.1).\n\n2. **Register for the back papers in the summer semester or as a supplementary exam**: If the student is not able to register for the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses, they can register for the back papers in the summer semester or as a supplementary exam. This will allow the student to clear the back papers without overloading themselves with too many courses in the 4th semester.\n\n3. **Postpone registering for some 4th-semester courses**: If the student is not able to clear the back papers along with the 4th-semester courses, they can postpone registering for some 4th-semester courses and focus on clearing the back papers first. This will allow the student to focus on clearing the back papers without overloading themselves with too many courses.\n\nTo provide more specific guidance, I would need to know the following information:\n\n* The specific courses offered in the 4th semester for mechanical engineering students\n* The credit values of the back papers and the 4th-semester courses\n* The current semester load of the student\n\nWith this information, I can provide more tailored advice on how the student can clear their back papers while progressing to the next semester."

You need to complete a minimum of 15 credits of Programme Electives throughout your 8 semesters.\n\n**What is the difference between Open Elective (OE) and Programme Elective (PE)?**\n\nHere's a brief comparison:\n\n|  | Open Elective (OE) | Programme Elective (PE) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Definition** | Courses that are open to all students, regardless of their branch | Courses that are specific to a particular branch or program |\n| **Purpose** | To provide a broad-based education, exploring interests outside the main branch | To provide in-depth knowledge and specialization within the main branch |\n| **Credits** | Typically 3-4 credits per course | Typically 3-4 credits per course |\n| **Selection** | Can be chosen from a wide range of courses across departments | Must be chosen from a list of pre-approved courses within the department |\n| **Branch-specific** | No | Yes, specific to the student's branch |\n\nIn summary, Open Electives (OE) allow you to explore interests outside your main branch, while Programme Electives (PE) provide specialized knowledge within your branch.\n\nFor example, as a Computer Engineering student, you might choose an Open Elective like \"Introduction to Economics\" or \"Foreign Language\" to broaden your knowledge. On the other hand, your Programme Electives might include courses like \"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\" or \"Computer Vision and Image Processing\" to deepen your understanding of computer engineering concepts.\n\nDoes that clarify the difference?"
